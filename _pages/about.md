Welcome!

Thanks for stopping by. This site is a collection of some of my favorite personal projects — hands-on builds, technical explorations, and creative ventures. Each one represents a piece of my journey as a curious and collaborative learner, always looking for new ways to stretch my understanding of how things work and why.

Feel free to look around, and if something sparks your interest, I’d love to hear from you.

## A Bit About Me

I grew up in Kirkland, Washington, and moved to Irvine, California to study electrical engineering at UC Irvine. Outside of school, I spend time hiking, making music, tinkering with electronics, and connecting with people who share a love of building and discovery.

At the core of everything I do is a curiosity and a drive to understand; to explore the details behind the things I love and the world they shape. My hope is that, one day, these interests will evolve into work that helps solve meaningful problems and makes a real difference in people’s lives.

For the time being, I've created this website as a living archive of my exploration towards those goals.
